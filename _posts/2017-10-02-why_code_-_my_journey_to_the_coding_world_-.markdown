As a child, I always enjoyed playing around with my father's computer to try out different games and programs.  At that time, I had no idea what went behind them though.

As the internet business boomed, I became more interested in learning how to code.  But it had been difficult to take that initiation step.  Coding sounded time-consuming and expensive.  I already had a job and needed to pay off student loans. 

But somewhere in my mind, I always felt the urge to just take that step.

Most recently, through a series of family crisis, I became interested in the caregiving service industry and realized that there is no place for American consumers to safely search for and connect with an *affordable* caregiver.  For most families, home care service is prohibitively expensive, partly due to agency fees.  But, craigslist, which is the only free directory site reasonably available to the public, is simply not user-friendly.  

I've been exploring ways to build a user friendly, open, online community where people can connect with others for various types of services.  While I considered hiring a developer to build the site for me, but at the end of the day, I want to own my site and be able to develop the site on my own.  

For all these reasons, I decided to join the Flatiron program and be a self-starter.  

I am excited to learn coding; and I look forward to this process.
