To be honest, I am not sure if there was any **interesting** challenge I solved through this lab...

I did encounter multiple challenges while working on earlier labs that led up to the OO Tic Tac Toe lab; but by the time I reached the OO Tic Tac Toe lab, thoses challenges were mostly solved; and what I really concentrated during the final OO Tic Tac Toe lab was to place all the languages/sequences correctly (the tedious spacing and spelling errors always occurred) in a way the relevant spec sheet is satisfied.  

Of course, correctly grasping various ruby concepts, i.e. ruby instance variables, was not easy; but at the end of the day, through a little web surfing and reading, I could always get them right.  

Overall, what this lab taught me is that coding is not about being a genius.  It is really about patience and attention to details.  
At the end of the day, as long as I put extra time into reading  different concepts and terms (remembering keywords was not easy), I learned that I can eventually solve whatever problem I was facing.
